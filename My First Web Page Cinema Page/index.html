                    <p class="subtitle">San Diego (Spanish for 'Saint Didacus'; /ˌsæn diˈeɪɡoʊ/ SAN dee-AY-goh, Spanish: [san ˈdjeɣo]) is a city on the Pacific
                        Ocean coast of Southern California located immediately adjacent to the Mexico–United States border. With a 2020
                        population of 1,386,932,[9] it is the eighth-most populous city in the United States, the second-most populous city in

                        <p class="subtitle">Historically home to the Kumeyaay Native Americans, San Diego has been referred to as the Birthplace of California,
                        since it was the first site visited and settled by Europeans on what is now the U.S. West Coast.[14] Upon landing in San
                        Diego Bay in 1542, Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo claimed the area for Spain, forming the basis for the settlement of Alta
                        California 200 years later. The Presidio and Mission San Diego de Alcalá, founded in 1769, formed the first European
                        settlement in what is now California. In 1821, San Diego became part of the newly declared Mexican Empire, which
                        reformed as the First Mexican Republic two years later. California was conquered by the U.S. in 1848 following the
                        Mexican–American War and was admitted to the union as a state in 1850.
